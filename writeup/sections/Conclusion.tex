\section{Conclusion}


We have introduced MMD flow, a novel flow over the space of distributions, with a practical space-time discretized implementation and a regularisation scheme to improve convergence. We provide theoretical results, highlighting intrinsic properties of the regular MMD flow, and guarantees on convergence based on  recent results in optimal transport, probabilistic interpretations of PDEs, and particle algorithms. Future work will focus on a deeper understanding of  regularization for  MMD flow,
and its application in sampling and optimization for large neural networks.

%to which we make a first attempt here, would open to new algorithms for sampling or optimization of big neural networks.% Also, since this flow can be closely related to the optimization of very big neural networks with gradient descent, a deeper understanding of our noisy algorithm in comparison to regularization procedures used in deep learning nowadays, should be of great interest.

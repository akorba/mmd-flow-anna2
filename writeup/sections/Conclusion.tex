\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduces a novel flow over the space of distributions and an improved space-time discretized version of this algorithm. We provide theoretical results, highlighting intrinsic properties of the regular MMD flow and guarantees on the proposed algorithm, based on many recent results ranging from optimal transport, probabilistic interpretation of PDEs and particle algorithms. To go forward, a deeper understanding of how to regularize the MMD flow, to which we make a first attempt here, would open to new algorithms for sampling or optimization of big neural networks.% Also, since this flow can be closely related to the optimization of very big neural networks with gradient descent, a deeper understanding of our noisy algorithm in comparison to regularization procedures used in deep learning nowadays, should be of great interest.

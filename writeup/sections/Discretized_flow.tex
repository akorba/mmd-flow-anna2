\section{Algorithms}\label{sec:discretized_flow}

In this section, we study the discretized version of the MMD flow, in time and space. This leads to a new algorithm but which can be stuck in local minima in practice.\aknote{and thus highlighting the fact that the negative sobolev norm may not be bounded in practice?} We thus provide a new algorithm, relying on adding a noise/a regularization of the flow.% which derives from a regularized flow presented at the end of section \cref{sec:convergence_mmd_flow}.

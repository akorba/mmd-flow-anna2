%Although the MMD flow in $W_2$ decreases in time, it can very well
% remain stuck in local minima. This can happen for instance when the negative Sobolev norm in \eqref{eq:inequality_neg_sobolev} diverges. One way to see this, is by looking at the equilibrium condition for \cref{eq:time_evolution_mmd}.
%%\asnote{I think that the same problem happens with the dynamics of SVGD. Because KSD = 0 doesn't imply p = q unless absolute continuity + other requirements} 
%Indeed $t \mapsto \F(\nu_t)$ is a non-negative decreasing function, it must therefore converge to some limit, which implies in turn that its time derivative would also converge to $0$. Assuming that $\nu_t$ also converged to some limit distribution $\nu^{*}$
%\footnote{There are cases when $\nu_t$ does not converge to any $\nu^*$. This would happen if the sequence $(\nu_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is not tight.} 
%one can show under simple regularity conditions \aknote{which ones?} that the equilibrium condition:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:equilibrium_condition}
%	\int \Vert \nabla f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}(x)\Vert^2 \diff \nu^{*}(x) =0  
%\end{align}
%must hold. If $\nu^*$ turns out to have a positive density, then $f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}(x)$ would be constant everywhere. This in turn would mean that $f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}=0$ when the RKHS does not contain constant functions, as for a gaussian kernel. Hence, $\nu^*$ would be a global optimum since $\F(\nu^{*})=0$. However, the limit distribution $\nu^*$  might be very singular, it could even be a dirac distribution. \manote{here a figure would be nice}  This suggests that the gradient flow could converge to a suboptimal solution $\nu^*$ for which \cref{eq:equilibrium_condition} is true.

%In \cite[Proposition 3]{Mroueh:2019} such equilibria are excluded by assumption \cite[Assumption A]{Mroueh:2019} to provide convergence towards a global minimizer for the KSD. 
%In \cref{sec:Lojasiewicz_inequality} we show global convergence, under the boundedness at all times $t$ of a specific distance between $\nu_t$ and $\mu$.
%If $\nu^*$ turns out to have a positive density, then $f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}(x)$ would be constant everywhere. This in turn would mean that $f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}=0$ when the RKHS does not contain constant functions, as for a gaussian kernel. Hence, $\nu^*$ would be a global optimum since $\F(\nu^{*})=0$. 
%In \cite{mroueh2018regularized}, it is assumed that the only distribution $\nu^*$ satisfying the equilibrium condition is equal to $\mu$\aknote{true?}.  However, the limit distribution $\nu^*$  might be very singular, it could even be a dirac distribution. This suggests that the gradient flow could converge to a suboptimal solution $\nu^*$ for which
We showed in \cref{subsection:barrier_optimization} that $\F$ was a non-convex functional, then derived a condition in \cref{sec:Lojasiewicz_inequality} to reach the global optimum. Now, we would like to address the case when such condition does not necessarily hold and then provide a regularization of the gradient flow to help achieve global optimality. Our starting point will be the equilibrium condition in \cref{eq:equilibrium_condition}. If an equilibrium $\nu^*$ that satisfies \cref{eq:equilibrium_condition} happens to have a positive density, then $f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}$ would be constant everywhere. This in turn would mean that $f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}=0$ when the RKHS does not contain constant functions, as for a gaussian kernel. Hence, $\nu^*$ would be a global optimum since $\F(\nu^{*})=0$. However, the limit distribution $\nu^*$  might be very singular, it can even be a dirac distribution \cite[Theorem 6]{mei2018mean}. Although, the gradient $\nabla f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}$ is not identically $0$ in that case,  \cref{eq:equilibrium_condition} only evaluate it on the support $\nu^{*}$ on which $\nabla f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}=0$ holds. Hence a possible fix would be to make sure that such gradient is also evaluated at points outside of the support of $\nu^{*}$. 
Here, we propose to regularize the flow by injecting noise into the gradient during updates of \cref{eq:euler_scheme_particles}: %\aknote{abrupt. would be great to have a continuous analog}  
\begin{align}\label{eq:discretized_noisy_flow}
	X_{n+1} = X_{n} -\gamma \nabla f_{\mu,\nu_n}(X_n+ \beta_n U_n) \qquad n\geq 0
\end{align}
where $U_n$ is a standard gaussian variables and $\beta_n$ is the noise level at $n$. Compared to \cref{eq:euler_scheme}, here the sample is blurred first before evaluating the gradient.
Intuitively, if $\nu_n$ approaches a local optimum $\nu^{*}$, $ \nabla f_{\mu,\nu_n}$ would be small on the support of $\nu_n$ but it might be much larger outside of it, hence evaluating $\nabla f_{\mu,\nu_n}$ outside the support of $\nu_n$ might help escaping the local minimum. The stochastic process \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} is different from adding a diffusion term to \cref{eq:continuity_mmd}. Indeed, in the latter case, %the update equation would be:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:diffusion}
%	X_{n+1} = X_{n} -\gamma \nabla f_{\mu,\nu_n}(X_n)+ \beta_n U_n \qquad n\geq 0.
%\end{align}
%to construct, at least formally, a modified gradient flow for which the optimality condition would guarantee reaching the global optimum.
%Ideally, we would like to obtain an optimality condition of the form
%\begin{align}\label{eq:soothed_equilibrium_condition}
%	\int \Vert \nabla f_{\mu,\nu^{*}}(x)\Vert^2 \diff (\nu^{*}\star g)(x) =0  
%\end{align}
%where $\nu^{*}\star g$ means the convolution of $\nu^*$ with a gaussian distribution $g$. The smoothing effect of convolution directly implies that $\nu^{*}\star g$ has a positive density, which falls back in the scenario where the $\nu^*$ must a global optimum.
%We consider, at least formally, the following modified equation for $\nu_t$:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:smoothed_continuity_equation_mmd}
%	\partial_t \nu_t = div((\nu_t \star g) \nabla f_{\mu,\nu_t} )
%\end{align}
%This suggests a particle equation which would be given by:
%\begin{align}\label{eq:noisy_particles}
%	\dot{X}_t = -\nabla f_{\mu,\nu_t}( X_t + W_t  )
%\end{align}
%where $(W_t)$ is a brownian motion. Furthermore, $\F(\nu_t)$ satisfies
%\begin{align}\label{eq:smoothed_decreasing_mmd}
%	\dot{\F}(\nu_t) = -\int \Vert \nabla f_{\mu,\nu_t}(x)\Vert^2 \diff (\nu_t\star g)(x)
%\end{align}
%The existence and uniqueness of a solution to \cref{eq:smoothed_continuity_equation_mmd} for a general $g$ remains an open question to our knowledge. However, we find it useful here to state \cref{eq:smoothed_continuity_equation_mmd,eq:noisy_particles,eq:smoothed_decreasing_mmd} which are the modified analogs of \manote{ref to the analogs}.
 %\cref{eq:diffusion} 
it would correspond to regularizing $\F$ using an entropic term as in \cite{mei2018mean,csimcsekli2018sliced} (see also \cref{subsec:kl_flow} about the Langevin diffusion). \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} is also different from \cite{craig2016blob,carrillo2019blob} where $\F$ (and thus its associated velocity field) is regularized by convolving the interaction potential $W$ in \cref{eq:potentials} with a mollifier. However, the optimal solution of a regularized version of the functional $\F$ will be generally different from the non-regularized one, which is not desirable in our setting. 
%This is not the case for \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} where the global optimum of $\F$ is a fixed point, as it will be shown in this section. 
 %As shown in \manote{add this in the appendix}, \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} is associated to an augmented continuous-time dynamics  which decreases $\F$ under a condition on the noise level $\beta_k$:
In fact \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} is  closely related to the \textit{continuation methods} \cite{Gulcehre:2016a,Gulcehre:2016,Chaudhari:2017}  and \textit{graduated optimization} \cite{Hazan:2015} used for non-convex optimization in Euclidian spaces, which inject noise \textit{into} the gradient as well at each iteration. %Indeed given a non-convex cost function $F$, the graduated descent would lead to updates of the form: $X_{n+1} = X_n - \gamma \nabla F(X_n+\beta U_n )$. The main difference with \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} is the dependence of $f_{\mu, \nu_n}$ on $\nu_n$ which is inherently due to functional optimization.
We show in \cref{thm:convergence_noisy_gradient} that \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} attains the global minimum of $\F$ provided the level of the noise is well controlled.
%\begin{proposition}\label{thm:convergence_noisy_gradient}
%	Let $(\nu_n)_{n\geq 0}$ be defined by \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} with an initial $\nu_0$. Under \cref{assump:lipschitz_gradient_k,assump:Lipschitz_grad_rkhs}, and for a choice of $\beta_n$ such that:
%	\begin{equation}\label{eq:control_level_noise}
%		8\lambda^2\beta_n^2 \F(\nu_n) \leq \int \Vert \nabla f_{\mu,\nu_n}(x+\beta_n u) \Vert^2 g(u) \diff \nu_n(x)\diff u   
%	\end{equation}
%	 the following inequality holds:
%	\begin{equation}\label{eq:decreasing_loss_iterations}
%		\F(\nu_{n+1}) - \F(\nu_n  ) \leq -\frac{\gamma}{2}(1-3\gamma L)\int \Vert \nabla f_{\mu,\nu_n}(x+\beta_n u) \Vert^2 g(u) \diff\nu_n(x) \diff u.
%	\end{equation}
%$\lambda$ and $L$ are defined in \cref{assump:lipschitz_gradient_k,assump:Lipschitz_grad_rkhs} and depend only on the choice of the kernel, and $g$ is the density of the standard gaussian distribution. Moreover, if  $\sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i^2 \rightarrow \infty $ then:
%\begin{equation}
%\F(\nu_n)\leq \F(\nu_0) e^{-4\lambda^2\gamma(1-3\gamma L)\sum_{i=0}^n \beta^2_i}
%\end{equation}
%\end{proposition}
\begin{proposition}\label{thm:convergence_noisy_gradient}
	Let $(\nu_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ be defined by \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} with an initial $\nu_0$. Denote $\mathcal{D}_{\beta_n}(\nu_n)=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim \nu_n, u\sim g}[\Vert \nabla f_{\mu,\nu_n}(x+\beta_n u) \Vert^2]$ with $g$ the density of the standard gaussian distribution.	Under \cref{assump:lipschitz_gradient_k,assump:Lipschitz_grad_rkhs}, and for a choice of $\beta_n$ such that:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:control_level_noise}
	8\lambda^2\beta_n^2 \F(\nu_n) \leq \mathcal{D}_{\beta_n}(\nu_n),
	\end{equation}
	\begin{flalign}\label{eq:decreasing_loss_iterations}
\text{The following inequality holds: }\quad\quad	\F(\nu_{n+1}) - \F(\nu_n  ) \leq -\frac{\gamma}{2}(1-3\gamma L)\mathcal{D}_{\beta_n}(\nu_n), &&
	\end{flalign}
	where $\lambda$ and $L$ are defined in \cref{assump:lipschitz_gradient_k,assump:Lipschitz_grad_rkhs} and depend only on the choice of the kernel. Moreover, if  $\sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i^2 \rightarrow \infty $ then:
	\begin{equation}
	\F(\nu_n)\leq \F(\nu_0) e^{-4\lambda^2\gamma(1-3\gamma L)\sum_{i=0}^n \beta^2_i}
	\end{equation}
\end{proposition}



\begin{remark}
	  %This allows the algorithm to use non-local information on the loss landscape by probing the gradient in regions outside of the support of $\nu_k$. Thus this algorithm could potentially escape local optima. 
	At each iteration, the level of the noise needs to be adjusted such that the gradient is not too much blurred. This ensures that each step would decrease the loss functional. However, $\beta_n$ does not need to decrease at each iteration: it could increase adaptively whenever needed, i.e. when  the sequence gets closer to a local optimum, it is helpful to increase the level of the noise to probe the gradient in regions where its value is not flat.
	Notice that for $\beta_n = 0$  in \cref{eq:decreasing_loss_iterations} , we recover a similar bound as in \cref{prop:decreasing_functional}. %However, the interesting cases are when $\beta_n>0$.
	%The second crucial point, is the dependence of the level of the noise on the value of the loss functional itself in \cref{eq:control_level_noise}. This allows some tolerance for high levels of noise when the loss functional is already small. In fact this precise condition provides a Lojasiewicz type inequality for free, which will then be used in  to provide convergence rates in  \cref{sec:Lojasiewicz_inequality}.
 \end{remark}
%The natural question is whether \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} converges towards to global optimum of $\F$. The answer will depend on how much noise is allowed to be injected while still decreasing $\F$. The higher the $\beta_n$ is, the faster it will converge. This is made more precise in \cref{thm:convergence_noisy_gradient}: 
 %\begin{theorem}\label{thm:convergence_noisy_gradient}
 %Under \cref{assump:lipschitz_gradient_k,assump:Lipschitz_grad_rkhs} and if \cref{eq:control_level_noise} is satisfied for a sequence $(\beta_n)_{n\geq0}$ such that $\sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i^2 \rightarrow \infty $ then:
 %\begin{align}
 %	\F(\nu_n)\leq \F(\nu_0) e^{-4\lambda^2\gamma(1-3\gamma L)\sum_{i=0}^n \beta^2_i}
 %\end{align}
 %\end{theorem}
% A proof of \cref{thm:convergence_noisy_gradient} is provided in
A proof of \cref{thm:convergence_noisy_gradient} is provided in \cref{proof:thm:convergence_noisy_gradient} and relies on \cref{eq:control_level_noise} to get a Lojasiewicz inequality which then controls the decay of $\F(\nu_n)$. A particular case when $\sum_{i=0}^n \beta_i^2 \rightarrow \infty$ holds is when $\beta_n$ decays as $1/\sqrt{n}$ while still having \cref{eq:control_level_noise}. In this case, one gets polynomial convergence.
In \cref{sec:sample_based} we provide a practical algorithm for \cref{eq:discretized_noisy_flow} which involves a discretization in space.

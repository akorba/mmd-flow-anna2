Proofs:
\begin{itemize}
	%\item Get rates in $\nu_n$ (change Lyapunov function)
	\item Hard: Refine the bounds, quantify more precisely $K(\rho_n)$
	\item Hard: Polyak Lojasewicz (PL) for MMD. When is the condition on Negative Sobolev norms true?
	\item Finish to write the proof for Lambda convexity and Sample based
	\item refine the bound for sample-based
\end{itemize}


Experiments/Literature
\begin{itemize}
	\item Talk about Birth-Death Dynamics and Mroueh
	\item Experiments!!
\end{itemize}
everywhere: treat comments if possible

Add to appendix:\\

Given a probability distribution $\nu$ the \textit{weighted Sobolev semi-norm} is defined for all squared integrable functions $f$ in $L_2(\nu)$ as $ \Vert f \Vert_{\dot{H}(\nu)} = \left(\int \Vert \nabla f(x) \Vert^2 \diff \nu(x) \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ with the convention $\Vert f \Vert_{\dot{H}^1(\nu)} = +\infty$ if $f$ doesn't have a square integrable gradient.

%Proofs:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Hard: Refine the bounds, quantify more precisely $K(\rho_n)$
%	\item Hard: Polyak Lojasewicz (PL) for MMD. When is the condition on Negative Sobolev norms true?
%	\item Finish to write the proof for Lambda convexity and Sample based
%	\item refine the bound for sample-based
%\end{itemize}


%Experiments/Literature
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Talk about Birth-Death Dynamics and Mroueh
%	\item Experiments!!
%\end{itemize}
%everywhere: treat comments if possible

\subsection{MMD as a free energy}

Interestingly, for a fixed target distribution $\mu$, it appears that the $MMD^2$ can be written
as a free energy \cref{eq:lyapunov}, by choosing the potential energy $V$ and interaction energy $W$ as follows:
\begin{align}
V(x)=-\int  k(x,x')\mu(x')\text{,} \quad
W(x,x')=\frac{1}{2}k(x,x')
\end{align}
Indeed, in this case we have $(1/2)MMD^2(\rho,\mu)=C+ \int V(x) \rho(x)dx + \int W(x,x')\rho(x)\rho(x')$, where $C=(1/2)\E_{\mu\otimes \mu}[k(x,x')]$. 
 Hence, we can consider a flow $(\rho_t)_{t>0}$ as described in \cref{sec:gradient_flows_functionals} and the loss functional defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mmd_functional}
\F(\rho_t)=\frac{1}{2}MMD^2(\rho_t, \mu)=\frac{1}{2}\|f_t\|^2_{\kH}
%&= \E_{\rho_t \otimes \rho_t}[k(X,X')]+\E_{\pi \otimes \pi}[k(Y,Y')] - 2\E_{\rho_t \otimes \pi}[k(X,Y)]
\end{equation} 
where $f_t(z)= \int k(.,z)\diff \mu - \int k(.,z)\diff \rho_t$ to alleviate notations. The following proposition gives the time dissipation of $\F$ as well as the associated gradient flow.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:mmd_flow} The gradient flow associated to $F$ can be written:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:continuity_equation_mmd}
\frac{\partial \rho_t}{\partial t}= div(\rho_t  \nabla f_t)
\end{equation}
 where $\nabla f_t$ is the gradient of the witness function $f_t$, defined by $\nabla f_t(z)= \int \nabla_{z}k(.,z) d\mu -  \int \nabla_{z}k(.,z) d\rho_t$. Hence, the dissipation of $\F$ can be written:  
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{d \F(\rho_t)}{dt}=-\E_{X \sim \rho_t}[\|\nabla f_t(X)\|^2]\quad
 \end{equation}

\end{proposition}
\begin{remark}
	If the functional $\F$ was the KL divergence and $\rho_t$ a weak solution of the Fokker-Planck equation \cref{eq:Fokker-Planck}, we would obtain the following dissipation (see \cite{wibisono2018sampling}):
	\begin{align}\label{eq:decreasing_mmd}
	\frac{d KL(\rho_t, \mu)}{dt}=-\E_{X \sim \rho_t}[\|\nabla log(\frac{\rho_t}{\mu}(X))\|^2]
	\end{align}
\end{remark}
A stochastic process whose distribution satisfies \cref{eq:continuity_equation_mmd} can thus be written (see \cref{sec:ito_stochastic} on ItÃ´'s formula):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stochastic_process}
dX_t=-\nabla f_t(X_t) = - (\nabla V (X_t) + \nabla W * \rho_t(X_t))
\end{equation}
It can be interpreted as the position $X_t$ of a particle at time $t > 0$, following the velocity vector field $\nabla \frac{\partial{\F}}{\partial{\rho_t}}=\nabla f_t$.  Equation \eqref{eq:stochastic_process} is actually a Mac-Kean Vlasov model (see \cite{kac1956foundations}, \cite{mckean1966class}), a particular kind of SDE (Stochastic Differential Equation) driven by a Levy process:
\begin{align}\label{eq:theoretical_process}
&X_t=X_{0}+\int_{0}^t \sigma(X_s, \rho_s, \mu)ds \quad \text{for t in [0,T]}\\
&\forall s \in [0,T]\;,\quad \rho_s \text{ denotes the probability distribution of } X_s
\end{align}
with $\sigma(X_s, \rho_s, \mu)=-\nabla f_s(X_s)=\int \nabla_{X_s}k(.,X_s) d\rho_s -  \int \nabla_{X_s}k(.,X_s) d\mu$. Suppose that $k$ is bounded \aknote{as well as $\nabla_k$?} and measurable on $\X$, and that there exists $L_k$ such that $\forall x,y \in \X$, $\|\nabla k(x,.)-\nabla k(y,.) \|_{\kH}\le L_k \|x-y\|$. Hence, $\sigma$ is bounded and Lipschitz continuous in its first variable (if the kernel is itself Lipschitz), and linear in its second and third variable. 
\aknote{investigate conditions on the kernel for convergence, uniqueness. e.g. linear growth of the coefficient sigma? or does it relate to lambda convexity as santambrogio says? or Following Chizat Bach [CB18b] solutions exist for all t > 0 for appropriate initial $\mu_0$ that are compactly
	supported in $\X$?}
\begin{remark}
	Consider a family of particles whose density satisfy Equation\cref{eq:continuity_equation} for some free energy $\F$. Both KL and $MMD^2$ can be written as free energies \eqref{eq:lyapunov}, with a potential energy $V$ term which drive the particles to the target distribution $\mu$. While the entropy function $U$ in KL prevents the particle from "crashing" onto the mode of $\mu$, this role could be played by the interaction energy $W$ for $MMD^2$. Indeed, when $W$ is convex, this gives raise to a general aggregation behavior of the particles, while when it is not, the particles would push each other apart.\aknote{to check, ref malrieu?}

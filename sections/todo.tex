Proofs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Get rates in $\nu_n$ (change Lyapunov function)
	\item Hard: Refine the bounds, quantify more precisely $K(\rho_n)$
	\item Hard: Polyak Lojasewicz (PL) for MMD. When is the condition on Negative Sobolev norms true?
	\item Finish to write the proof for Lambda convexity and Sample based
\end{itemize}


Experiments/Literature
\begin{itemize}
	\item Investigate sample-based algorithm
	\item Birth-Death Dynamics
	\item Experiments!!
\end{itemize}
everywhere: treat comments if possible

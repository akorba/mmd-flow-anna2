\section{MMD Gradient flow - Algorithms, experiments}\label{sec:mmd_flow}

\subsection{MMD Descent - Theoretical algorithm}

We will consider a flow $(\rho_t)_{t>0}$ as described in \cref{sec:gradient_flows_functionals} and denote $f_t= \int k(.,z)\diff \mu - \int k(.,z)\diff \rho_t$. In this case:
\begin{equation}
\F(\rho_t)=\frac{1}{2}\|f_t\|^2_{\kH}
%&= \E_{\rho_t \otimes \rho_t}[k(X,X')]+\E_{\pi \otimes \pi}[k(Y,Y')] - 2\E_{\rho_t \otimes \pi}[k(X,Y)]
\end{equation} 

We define the potential energy (also called confinement energy) $V$ and interaction energy $W$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
V(X)=-\int 2 k(X,x')\mu(x')\text{,} \quad
W(X,Y)=k(X,Y)
\end{equation}
We have $MMD^2(\rho,\mu)=C+ \int V(x) \rho(x)dx + \int W(x,x')\rho(x)\rho(x')$, where $C=\E_{\mu\otimes \mu}[k(Y,Y')]$. $MMD^2$ can thus be written as a \textit{Lyapunov functional} (or "free energy" or "entropy") $\F$. \aknote{add that interestingly, both KL and MMD have the V potential term, but the diffusion of the particle derive from U for KL and from W for MMD?}


\begin{proposition}\label{prop:mmd_flow}
 The velocity in \eqref{eq:continuity_equation1} is given by $\nabla \frac{\partial{\F}}{\partial{\rho_t}}=2 \nabla f_t$ and the dissipation of MMD can be written:  
	\begin{equation}
	\frac{d MMD^2(\rho_t, \mu)}{dt}=-\E_{X \sim \rho_t}[\|\nabla f_t(X)\|^2]
	\end{equation}
	where $\nabla f_t(Y)= \int \nabla_{Y}k(.,Y) d\mu -  \int \nabla_{Y}k(.,Y) d\rho_t$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
	If the functional $\F$ was the KL divergence and $\rho_t$ a weak solution of the Fokker-Planck equation \eqref{eq:Fokker-Planck}, we would obtain the following dissipation (see \cite{wibisono2018sampling}):
	\begin{equation}
	\frac{d KL(\rho_t, \mu)}{dt}=-\E_{X \sim \rho_t}[\|\nabla log(\frac{\rho_t}{\mu}(X))\|^2]
	\end{equation}
\end{remark}


As explained in \cref{sec:gradient_flows_functionals} and according to \cref{prop:mmd_flow}, the gradient flow of the MMD can be written:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial \rho_t}{\partial t}= div(\rho_t  \nabla f_t)
\end{equation*}
which is the density of the stochastic process (see \cref{sec:ito_stochastic}):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stochastic_process}
dX_t=-\nabla f_t(X_t) 
\end{equation}
\eqref{eq:stochastic_process} represents the position $X_t$ of a particle at time $t > 0$.
We naturally consider the Euler discretization of \eqref{eq:stochastic_process}, which gives:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:discretized_process}
X_{k+1}=X_k - \gamma_{k+1} \nabla f_k(X_k)
\end{equation}
where $\nabla f_k(X_k)= \int \nabla_{X_k}k(X,X_k)\diff \mu - \int \nabla_{X_k}k(X,X_k) \diff \rho_k$ with $\rho_k$ the distribution of the process \eqref{eq:discretized_process} and $(\gamma_k)_{k\ge1}$ is a sequence of step sizes.
